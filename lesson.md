# Lesson

## Brief

### Preparation

We will be using the `ml` environment for this lesson.

### Lesson Overview

This lesson introduces the concept of machine learning and the different types of machine learning and variable. We will then dive into our first supervised learning algorithms- linear regression, logistic regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Part 2 - Supervised Learning Algorithms

We will be using the `notebooks/supervised_learning_1_lesson.ipynb` notebook throughout this lesson.

> 1. Activate the environement `conda activate ml`.
> 2. Run `jupyter notebook`.
> 3. In the notebook, open `notebooks/supervised_learning_1_lesson.ipynb`.
> 4. Follow on with the lesson in the notebook.
